# # The Distribution of Wealth and the MPC
#

# %% [markdown]
# This notebook presents a selection of results from the paper [The Distribution of Wealth and the Marginal Propensity to Consume](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC), using the [Econ-ARK/HARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK) toolkit.  It sketches the steps that would need to be taken to solve the model using the [dolARK](https://github.com/EconForge/dolARK) modeling system.

# ## Contribution
#
# A principle problem in consumption economics is the development of a model
# that fits the empirical distribution of the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) as
# a function of wealth, given that the is high wealth inequality.
#
# Prior macroeconomic models that have assumed homogeneous agents have had the results
# of low wealth inequality. Krusell and Smith (1998) were the first to explain inequality in wealth through heterogeneity of agent discount factors. They modeled each intergenerational dynasty as having a discount factor that varies over time as a Markov process. They found this increase wealth inequality.
#
# This work finds a greater fit to the empirical distribution of wealth can be attained by modeling heterogeneity in discount factors as stable across generations. The discount factor distribution is uniform, with the breadth of the distribution determined by one free paramater. Fitting this parameter with a simple estimation process results in a model which fits the empirics better than Krusell and Smith (1998).

# For a microeconomic consumer with 'Market Resources' $M_{t}$ (net worth plus current income; basically, everything the consumer owns), end-of-period assets $A_{t}$ will be the amount remaining after consuming $C_{t}$:  <!-- Next period's 'Balances' $B_{t+1}$ reflect this period's $A_{t}$ augmented by return factor $R$:-->
# \begin{eqnarray}
# A_{t}   &=&M_{t}-C_{t}.  \label{eq:DBCparts}
# \end{eqnarray}
#
# The consumer's permanent noncapital income $P$ (in the sense of [Friedman (1957)](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/ATheoryv3NBER.pdf)) grows by a predictable factor $\PermGroFac$ and is subject to an unpredictable lognormally distributed multiplicative shock $\mathbb{E}_{t}[\psi_{t+1}]=1$, 
# \begin{eqnarray}
# P_{t+1} & = & P_{t} \PermGroFac \psi_{t+1}
# \end{eqnarray}
# and actual income is permanent income multiplied by a logormal multiplicative transitory shock, $\mathbb{E}_{t}[\theta_{t+1}]=1$, so that next period's market resources are
# \begin{eqnarray}
# %M_{t+1} &=& B_{t+1} +P_{t+1}\theta_{t+1},  \notag
# M_{t+1} &=& A_{t}R +P_{t+1}\theta_{t+1}.  \notag
# \end{eqnarray}
#
# When the consumer has a standard Constant Relative Risk Aversion utility function $u(c)=\frac{c^{1-\rho}}{1-\rho}$, that the problem can be written in terms of ratios of money variables to permanent income, e.g. $m_{t} \equiv M_{t}/P_{t}$, and the Bellman form of [the problem reduces to](http://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/BufferStockTheory/#The-Related-Problem):
#
# \begin{eqnarray*}
# v_t(m_t) &=& \max_{c_t}~~ u(c_t) + \beta~\mathbb{E}_{t} [(\Gamma\psi_{t+1})^{1-\rho} v_{t+1}(m_{t+1}) ] \\
# & s.t. & \\
# a_t &=& m_t - c_t \\
# m_{t+1} &=& R/(\Gamma \psi_{t+1}) a_t + \theta_{t+1} \\
# \end{eqnarray*}
#
# and the [Euler equation](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/lecturenotes/Consumption/Envelope) for this model is 
#
# \begin{align*}
# c_{t}^{-\rho} & = R \beta \mathbb{E}_{t}[(\Gamma \psi c_{t+1})^{-\rho})] %\\
# % 0 & = & R \beta \mathbb{E}_{t}[(\Gamma \psi c_{t+1}/c_{t})^{-\rho})]-1

# ## Time Preference Heterogeneneity
#
# Our specific approach is to replace the assumption that all households have the same time
# preference factor with an assumption that, for some dispersion $\nabla$, time
# preference factors are distributed uniformly in the population between
# $\grave{\Discount}-\nabla$ and $\grave{\Discount}+\nabla$ (for this reason, the model is referred to as the $\Discount$-Dist model).  Then,
# using simulations, we search for the values of $\grave{\Discount}$ and
# $\nabla$ for which the model best matches the fraction of net worth held by the top $20$, $40$, $60$, and $80$ percent of the population, while at the same time matching
# the aggregate capital-to-output ratio from the perfect foresight
# model. Specifically, defining $w_{i}$ and $\omega _{i}$ as the proportion of total aggregate net worth held by the top $i$ percent in our model and in the data, respectively, we solve the following minimization problem:
#
# $$  \{\grave{\Discount}, \nabla\}= \underset{\{{\Discount}, \nabla\}}{\text{argmin} }\Big(\sum_\text{i=20, 40, 60, 80}
#   \big(w_{i}({\Discount}, \nabla)-\omega _{i}\big)^{2}\Big)^{1/2}$$
#   subject to the constraint that the aggregate wealth (net worth)-to-output ratio in the model matches the aggregate
# capital-to-output ratio from the perfect foresight model ($\KLev_{PF}/\YLev_{PF}$). Increasing the number of points further does not notably change the results below. When solving the problem for the FBS specification we shut down the aggregate shocks (practically, this does not affect the estimates given their small size).
#  
# $$\KLev / \YLev = \KLev_{PF} / \YLev_{PF}$$
#
# The solution to this problem is $\{\grave{\Discount}, \nabla\}=\{0.9867, 0.0067\}$
# , so that the discount factors are evenly spread roughly between 0.98 and 0.99. We call the optimal value of the objective function the 'Lorenz distance' and use it as a measure of fit of the models.
#
# The introduction of even such a relatively modest amount of time
# preference heterogeneity sharply improves the model's fit to the targeted
# proportions of wealth holdings, bringing it reasonably in line with the data.
