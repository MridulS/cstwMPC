This directory contains Mathematica programs that produce the results of the model with aggregate PERMANENT shocks (results reported in Section 4 of the paper). 

 - SolveAndSimPoint.nb: runs \[Beta]-Point model. 
 - SolveAndSimDistSeven.nb: runs \[Beta]-Dist model (with seven types). 

 - PlotDistributionsMPCsDistSevenPerm.nb: plots distribution of MPCs in cases of matching the distribution of net worth, financial assets, and liquid financial assets. 

 - If "Fin" is included in the file name, the distribution of financial assets is matched to obtain the solution. Similarly, if "LiqFinPlsRet" means liquid financial assets and retirement assets and "LiqFin" means liquid financial assets.
