This directory contains Mathematica programs that produce the results of the model WITHOUT aggregate shock. 

 - FindBeta.nb estimates \[Beta] which matches agg K (essentially the same as matching K/Y ratio). The model with point (unique) time pref factor is used. 

 - FindBetaDistSeven.nb
 - FindBetaDistSevenReiterOnly.nb 
   Both files use the same model with uniformly distributed (heterogeneosu) time discount factors, and estimate \[Beta]Middle (middle point of the distribution of \[Beta]) and interval "diff" between neighboring approximated points. (The distribution of time preference factor \[Beta] is assumed to be uniform and approximated by 7 points.)
   The former file matches wealth LEVELS (and report results in section 2 of the paper) using simulations, while the latter matches wealth/permanent income ratios without using simulations.

 - SolveAndSimKSNoAggShock.nb run the KS-JEDC model with aggregate shocks turned off. 


 - PlotWYRatioSCF_AndDistSeven.nb.nb plots wealth/perm income ratios (both US data and data generated by the \[Beta]-Dist model).

 - If "Fin" is included in the file name, the distribution of financial assets is matched to obtain the solution. Similarly, if "LiqFinPlsRet" means liquid financial assets and retirement assets and "LiqFin" means liquid financial assets.
